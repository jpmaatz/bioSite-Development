    <p>Evian was born in 2014 and was and remains an active kid. He is very interested in learning new things and has established his independence at an early age. He will always attempt something on his own before asking for help, for better or worse. At the age of 3, Evian started his first ice skating classes. He has continued to build on his skill and continues to learn as he gets older</p>
